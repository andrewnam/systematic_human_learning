1	ca04a1	The middle box on the left has both a 7 and a 4. I then looked in the row of the 7 of that box and saw the 4 on the same row on the box on the right hand side. This eliminated the possibility of the blue box of that row being either 7 or 4. And because the box in the middle of the left side also contains a 4, that meant the blue box of that same row could be a 7. Thus, the answer was 4.	Both	Both	C.

3	b5c803	The top middle box already has a 1. The blue square in the middle box can't have a 1 because there's a 1 in that row already. The blue square in the bottom box can't have a 1 because there's a 1 in that row already.	Target	Target	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere		The rule is implicit in this case, but the strategy is clear.
4	1833ce	I used the process of elimination. The number had to be either 3 or 5. I went empty cell by empty cell and determined the only possible number.	Both	Both	D.

Hard to choose between D and H
5	2e8ec7	I figured that it had to be 8 because nothing else in that row could be 2. Next i checked the surrounding boxes to see which number would best fit. Or whatever number shared the same box or or row and collumn. If they did share columns i would make my final decision.	Both	Both	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	***Backwards. If they said "could be 8", or replaced "nothing" with "something" then it'd be correct.	Nothing else could be 2 is confused or confusing

7	4ae018	Find a row or column with 3 numbers. Select a pair that are not in the 3 numbers (this will be obvious from the other numbers not in the row - but maybe not in a fully populated puzzle). Then try to put the pair in every cell other than origin, like they are immigrants looking for a home. If both fit, move on. When one fails to fit, it will fit in origin.	Both	Both	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	*** Backwards I'm guessing they meant to say "If both don't fit", and when they find a cell that only one PD can go, that's the answer. There's never a case where both fit, so it seems reasonable to assume they made a mistake in their description.	Could have been clearer but it's interesting that they are aware this only applies to our puzzles!  I like the immigrants looking for a home!  If both fit is actually not stated correctly -- if neither fit, move on!  So H could be a strict assignment!

13	80cc0e	I looked along the blue boxes and saw which ones didn't have the number 9 or 7 in them. Then I looked at the individual squares to see which already had 9 or 7 and eliminated those from my answer. The answer I chose was the only spot left it would fit.	Both	Both	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis		d or H??
14	1460a0	I looked the the top column first and saw the 8 and 1 were in the same box so I could rule out the top box. I then moved down to the middle 3x3 box and saw both an 8 and 1 so that rules that box out. I lastly went to the last box and saw that that blue box could not be 1 but could be 8. Therefore I could figure out that the green box was a 1 and not an 8.	Both	Both	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not

16	880ada	The row to the right already has a number in the blue square and the row beside it would be 7, so since there is already a seven in the row, that only leave a 9 for the green square.	Both	Both	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	Seems like they're using 'row' to mean 'cell', and determined that the empty cell can contain 7	The word choice is poor but he seems to say that 7 must go in the 2nd cell from the right, which is correct, thus making the 9 the answer
17	1af36d	I assessed the key numbers (5 and 4) and checked where they both fall, then separated the lines where they are both aligned then used the remaining boxes and placed them in.	Both	Both	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	Really poorly written, but it seems like they're describing the shortcut variant. "Where they both fall" is probably referring to the box constraint. "lines where they are both aligned" probably refers to the column with both the target and distractor. "The remaining boxes", I'm guessing, refers to the column with only one number in it, which is the target.	
18	e41709	The answer had to be 7. 4 and 7 negate 4 or 7 being the answer to any of blue squares in the middle box on the right. 4 & 7 appear together in the third column from the left so it couldn't be either of those. 7 appears in the only column that doesn't have a number in the blue box, so that box could be a 4. Hence the answer has to be 7.	Both	Both	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	Kind of split between B and C here. "so that box could be a 4" makes it sound like B, but "7 appears" makes it sound like C.	one but not the other a reasonable second choice here

One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	Doesn't really explain why 5th cell must be 7.	Not totally clear but of a, b, and c this is what this answer points to

21	c87080	I basically scanned over each grid, and then canceled out the 5's first, and then determined it would have to be a 3.	Both	Both	D. Potentially valid but general or not fully specified	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	Looks like process of elimination, but doesn't explain why answer was chosen.	
22	fd56d9	I see what two numbers are the most on the board. From there I see how many places one of the numbers can fit on the blue line. If it can fit in 2 different places than that means I must add the other number to the green box.	Both	Both	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other

24	7be1e0	I looked at rows / sections I could rule out b/c they contained both numbers. Then I looked at which blocks could have one of the numbers. Finally, I put in the remaining number.	Both	Both	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	D. Potentially valid but general or not fully specified		I chose both for pd because they mentioned 'both numbers'.  Borderline for me between D and H
25	04163c	My strategy was very simple I focused o the numbers """"7 & 4"""" After that I choose the number which I think has more chances to be in the blue box.	Both	Both	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis

One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	*** Backwards. If they said "couldn't be 7" or "could be 4", this would be correct.

28	2583d8	I took the 1s away from te blue box then did the same for the 8s and then tried to figure which possibility the 1 or 8 went.	Both	Both	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis		
29	4e726b	i looked at the numbers around the one i currently placed.	Neither	Neither	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis		
30	7f6076	in that row and column ,there was not a similar number to the 1 i chose.	Neither	Neither	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis		Sounds like an ADC strategy but with implicit restriction to the two pd's
31	c81753	I started with the far left 3 blue squares and determined none of those could be a 3 or 9 bc they already below to a 3x3 square that contains those numbers. I then moved on to the columns on the left side of the screen. The first column contains a 3 and 9 so I moved to the next column with an open blue square. That column has a 9 in it so I know it has to be a 3.	Both	Both	C. Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	H. Unclear, confused or missing basis	They mean far-right, referencing the box constraint.	I beiieve this is an example of an errorful and slightly incomplete description of a valid strategy.  Left in first line was intended to be 'right' (a mistake people often make. most of all me!).  The end of the description is misleading but I think this really reflects strategy B.  Nevertheless, the lack of clarity requires me to choose H.
32	406960	I looked at each blue box and checked to see if an 8 could be used anywhere else besides that box. If none could I knew that would be my answer. I randomly chose to start with the 8, if that one didn't work I would have moved on to another number.	Target	Target	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere		Not perfectly clear but this seems to be what was intended.

36	9ac645	I figured that the leftmost blue square could be 4, which meant that the square I am supposed to solve would be 1.	Both	Both	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	Doesn't explain why it'd be 4	
37	5c8a8c	I started by looking at where the 5's and 9's were in the other boxes. I traced them to the row of blue to see which of the blue squares could not have the 5's and 9's. By using that process, I eliminated all of the boxes that could not possibly have a 5 and 9, which left me with the solution.	Both	Both	D. Potentially valid but general or not fully specified	D. Potentially valid but general or not fully specified	Process of elimination, but doesn't explain why answer was chosen.	or H!

39	3a34a5	I checked to see where there could or not be other fours or fives. It seemed to fit the rule to put a 4 in the empty slot.	Both	Both	D.

40	b3b8b2	I first located the 9 box quadrant that the blue shaded section intercedes where the two numbers are located (in this case, the bottom middle quadrant). This eliminates both numbers from the bottom three blue shaded squares. Then I identify the row that contains both numbers (in this case the fourth row from the bottom). This eliminates both numbers from the fourth blue shaded box from the bottom. Then I can eliminate the top blue shaded box from containing a 6, because it is already contained in that top row. This leaves only one shaded blue box remaining where the 6 must be located.	Both	Both	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	A. Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere		A little unclear
