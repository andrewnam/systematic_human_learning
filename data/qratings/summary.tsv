1	Persistent Solver	1	1	Female	20	12	5	TRUE	TRUE	I narrowed down the amount of spaces that could hold a number 5 by following along the rows.	0
2	Persistent Solver	1	1	Female	18	12	7	TRUE	TRUE	I first found the 3x3 box with the numbers 9 and 8 and eliminated those blue boxes because neither of those numbers could be used again there. Then, I found the column between the numbers 7 and 4 and eliminated the blue box because the column contained 9 and 8. Finally, from the two columns left, I concluded that the blue box that shared the column with an 8 must be 9. So then, the remaining box must be 8.	2
3	Persistent Solver	1	1	Male	30	16	2	TRUE	TRUE	I used a process of elimination. I eliminated the possible squares for 8. I realized 8 can only be in one square due to contradictions. Thus, I determined the correct answer was 8.	1
4	Persistent Solver	1	0.984375	Female	66	12	2	TRUE	TRUE	I saw that there was a 4 and 8 in the bottom middle grid. This let me know that those were two numbers i was interested in, since they eliminated themselves from contention for the column in question. I then looked at the non eliminated boxes in the column and checked to see if they were also eliminated by an 8 or 4 in their row. You can see that the top bow in our row is eliminated by the 8 to its left, meaning that box could still be a 4. The second empty box is eliminated by both 8 on the left and 4 on the right, it cant be either of those numbers. Since the last 3 boxes in our column are eliminated by the 4 and 8 in that grid, it leaves only one space available left for the 8 to go in our column.	2
5	Persistent Solver	1	0.984375	Female	47	16	2	TRUE	TRUE	I checked each open blue square to see if there was an 8 in the row, column or 9 square, I concluded there was not. I checked the 6 and there was another blue square option where the 6 could go. So, I concluded the 8 belonged in the green square.	2
6	Persistent Solver	1	0.984375	Female	35	21	3	TRUE	FALSE	1) I eliminated the 3 spaces in the 3x3 box that already contain 1 and 2.<>2) I moved to the center box to confirm that neither number could be in the space to the left of the green box.<>3) I moved to the final 3x3 square to see which of the 2 could be placed there, leaving me with the answer for the green space.	1
7	Persistent Solver	1	0.96875	Male	38	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	1.  In the center block,  the 5 on the top rules out the blue cell on the right.<>2. The 5 at the bottom rules out the blue cell in the middle.<>3. In the left block, the 5 rules out all three blue cells.<>4.The 5 can only be located in the green cell.<>	2
8	Persistent Solver	1	0.96875	Male	31	21	4	TRUE	TRUE	I first identified the 3x3 square that contained two numbers outside of the blue-shaded row. I noted that these numbers were 2 and 3, and then I looked for their locations in rows that:<><>1) didn't cross that same 3x3 square<>2) didn't contain numbers in their blue-shaded square.<>3) Didn't include the green/yellow target square<><>There were two rows matching this description. Of these two rows, I identified the one that contained only one number. This number was  2. I therefore entered 2 in the target square.<>	2
9	Persistent Solver	1	0.96875	Female	40	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	I located the larger square with two numbers in it (6 and 1) that also contained  three small blue squares. This told me the green square would have a 6 or 1. I then checked to see if 6 could fit in one of the two remaining blue squares. Since there was already a 6 in each row I knew 6 had to be the solution for the green square.	2
10	Persistent Solver	1	0.9375	Male	30	16	7	TRUE	TRUE	used a scratch sheet of paper, looked at row one at a time to not confuse myself with the other rows.	0
11	Persistent Solver	1	0.921875	Female	39	18	2	TRUE	TRUE	1. I saw that the number would be 3 or six.<>2. I determined the block of nine with both the 3 and the 6 so I could ignore that block. <>3. Then I looked for where the 3 and the 6 where together on a line to eliminate it. <>4. FInally I found the line with the 6 and knew that the other 6 had to be in the last remaining block.	2
12	Persistent Solver	1	0.828125	Female	27	18	2	TRUE	TRUE	I looked at each row to find a number that was the only one on the row. Then I look to see if it is the only one in the box. If it is I look at what the opposite number would go in the column, then I go to the spot I'm trying to fill and choose the other opposite number of the one that would go in that row.	1
13	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.984375	Male	23	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	Basically I used the process of elimination. In the first cell and the second cell I see that 5 is unable to go there cause it would be redundant across the row. Moving on the columns are already filled with 2, 4, 5, and 6 so I don't need to worry about those. Then I know that the box at the bottom middle cannot contain any more 9 and 5's. So the only place that leaves to input 5 is the green box.	2
14	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.984375	Male	68	21	7	TRUE	TRUE	No 3 or 4 in the 3 left blue squares. No 3 or 4 in the forth one. No 3 in the remaining empty square. The only place for 3 is the green one.	2
15	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.96875	Male	50	16	7	TRUE	TRUE	Looking at the most shown numbers  given and comparing to the other numbers given, you can figure out the correct number that is missing.	0
16	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.921875	Female	55	20	4	TRUE	TRUE	the box could only contain a 5 or a 4. the box on the farthest right in this row can contain a 4 therefore the box must be a 5	2
17	Persistent Solver	0.92	1	Female	29	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	I eliminated the five and one from the final three boxes because they were already filled in the other two boxes of the 3x3 box so they cannot be shared. I then looked at columns that had five and one, and two columns had 5 and one column had one. The two columns couldn't have five twice, so I only remained with one possibility, that's why I placed the number in the box with certainty.	2
18	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.984375	Male	48	16	2	TRUE	TRUE	First, I noted that the answer had to be 2 or 7, because these are the numbers appearing outside this column. Second, I asked whether the 2 could go anywhere else in the column than in the box of interest, and saw or started to see that it could not. Next, I checked my intuition that 2 was the correct answer by verifying that the 7 could go in at least two places in the row, i.e. in the box of interest or in the next available box (below the 6), which indeed proved to be the case, thus verifying that the answer had to be 2.	2
19	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.90625	Female	35	16	9	TRUE	TRUE	In the blue column, the bottom three blocks are within a 3x3 blocks having 1 and 8, so these bottom 3 blocks can't be 1 or 8.  In the middle three blue blocks, the bottom block is in a line having 1 and 8, so it can't be 1 or 8. In the top three blue blocks, there is a line with 1. Thus, the middle block in the middle three blocks should be 1. I use the way to exclude blocks and find out which block should be exclusive for 1 or 8.	2
20	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.9375	Male	43	12	8	TRUE	TRUE	Find a number that is alone in a row or column perpendicular to the solvable row. This number must not be in a box that includes the solvable row. That first number that was found is the answer	1
21	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.984375	Female	26	12	3	TRUE	TRUE	1. My first step involves finding the 3x3 grid which eliminates both numbers (in this case 7 and 1) from all 3 of it's blue cells. In this case it is the top-most grid.<><>2. After eliminating these 3 cells, I check to see if any rows have both a 1 and 7 on them, thereby eliminating the number from the corresponding blue cell entirely. In this case I am able to eliminate the cell in the row which is fourth from the top.<><>3. I locate the remaining possible cells. Narrowing my choices makes it easier to choose. I try to find the blue cell which would allow either a 1 or a 7, in order to single out which remaining number belongs in the green cell. I find that a 1 can be placed in the bottom row, but it is already filled. The cell just above the 6 is the only blue cell which could have a 1 or a 7, only there is a 1 in it's row, so I must put in a 7.<><>4. After eliminating the 7 I know that the only number which can be placed in the green cell is a 1.	2
22	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.90625	Female	24	12	1	TRUE	FALSE	basically i only look at the two digits used outside the blue row then i narrow down which column couldnt possibly be but one of the digits since no column or row can repeat digits	0
23	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.984375	Male	23	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	First, I couldn't put use either number in the lower 3 blue spaces. Second, I couldn't put either number in the blue space below the 6. I could put number 7 in the topmost blue space, because the 2 in that row wouldn't prevent me from doing so. So I should put 2 in the only remaining possible blue space (between the 3 and the 6).	2
24	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.96875	Male	31	12	2	TRUE	TRUE	Identify the two potential numbers, 6/8.<>Search for the row/column (row here cuz the blue is vertical) with a single one of those two options with an empty blue cell that is not inside the 3x3 cell with the two options (ie bottom middle in this one).<>That is the answer.	2
25	Persistent Solver	0.92	1	Male	41	14	3	TRUE	TRUE	I can see that the middle block has both of the other horizontal rows filled with 1's (vs only one 2) and the top block (with the blue row) has both a 1 in it so the answer has to be a 1	2
26	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.9375	Female	38	12	1	FALSE	TRUE	I saw multiple 7's and multiple 2's.  Assuming that the answer was one of those two numbers I looked over and chose 7 because it at quick glance seemed the most likely to belong there.  I chose to go on the multiples because I noticed the trend of using the multiples as an answer during the 120 second timed puzzles as well as the tutorial screens	0
27	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.890625	Male	28	18	8	FALSE	TRUE	I paid attention to the numbers blocking the blue line to help decide what cannot go into the green block	0
28	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.953125	Male	27	16	4	TRUE	FALSE	First I looked to see which 3 x 3 block had the numbers 4 and 3 within it. I mentally noted that the 3 x 3 block with those two numbers already there could not contain another 3 or 4. I looked to the next column that I 3 or 4 could belong in. I noticed that a 4 could exist in that column but a 3 could not. That made me realize that 3 belonged in the green box.	2
29	Persistent Solver	0.96	1	Female	43	12	1	FALSE	TRUE	At first I looked at the box in the middle upper are 4 and 8 so the correct number is 4 or 8, then I looked at other rows where are not numbers and there are 4 both of them so it has to be 4.	2
30	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.9375	Male	20	12	3	TRUE	TRUE	I looked for the box the two numbers then i looked for the row with two numbers lined up with the blue box then i looked for the row with one number lined up with the empty blue box	1
31	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.953125	Female	30	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	the answer could be either 7 or 5 based on the numbers on the grid, the grid above has already a 5 and 7 the grid on the right only has a 5 so the answer is 7	0
32	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.9375	Male	41	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	I know the correct answer has to be 6 or 2, so I need to eliminate one of those numbers. I first eliminate the 3X3 square that has both the 6 and the 2 inside of it and that same 3X3 square is part of the highlighted row. Then I simply check the other 2 columns to see if either the 6 or 2 is in one or both of those rows. Since the 2 is already taken in 2 of the rows, the only other place to put a 2 is in my row. I hope that explains it.	2
33	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.921875	Male	19	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	First I scanned the white area to see what two numbers repeated (in this case, 3 and 2). I then looked for the one line in which there was only one number with a an empty blue space (there is a line like this in every puzzle). In this puzzle it was 2, so I know the blue blank must be three. That means the green blank space must be 2. In many of the puzzles, I simply looked for this number and filled in the blank. To be clear, I did not rest on this strategy at first, but after so many puzzles, I was able to figure out a short cut to get to the end. Hope this helps. Best of luck on the research.	1
34	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.984375	Female	46	20	5	TRUE	TRUE	1. I determined that a 7 could possibly fit into the first empty light blue square.<>2. I noted that an 8 would not work in that square because there was already an 8 in the column.<>3. I noted that neither an 8 or 7 would fit into the third empty light blue square because there was already an 8 and 7 in that column.<>4. I also noted that neither an 8 or 7 could be used for the last three light blue blank squares because there was already an 8 and 7 in the 9x9 grid.<>5. The only place the 8 would fit is in the second empty light blue square.	2
35	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.9375	Other	31	10	3	TRUE	TRUE	I first found the square that contained both a 4 and 2 which blocked those space. I then looked for the open spaces in the columns and followed each row and noticed which ones where blocked by two numbers. I then looked at the last space that was not green and saw that it was blocked by a 2. The green space was the only space to put a 2 so that is the answer.	2
36	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.90625	Female	20	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	I checked the columns and the rows to see if the number 6 or 9 was in any of them and the box on the top already had a 6 and a 9 so I cancelled that one out. The box below had the 6 and the 9 in the same row, and the box in the middle had the 9 in the bottom row so that left 6 available in the middle row of the box.	2
37	Persistent Solver	0.96	0.921875	Male	28	14	4	TRUE	TRUE	I first saw that both a 3 and 6 appeared in one square section and eliminated those three from being either number.  Then found a column from containing both, therefore eliminating either from that column.  The only other available square has a 6 in the column so it must be a three.  And I am just realizing I chose the wrong answer.	2
38	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.984375	Female	34	18	2	TRUE	TRUE	I looked at the top set and determined that 5/9 could not be used in that blue column. I looked at bottom 9 on the left and determined that a 5 would have to go in the blue square of the same row. This left 9 as the anser to the green square.	2
39	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.890625	Male	45	16	2	TRUE	FALSE	i started in the 1st column and saw that 8 couldn't go there but 4 could so then knew 8 was the answer.	2
40	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.84375	Female	31	14	6	TRUE	TRUE	I actually realize now that I made a mistake while solving this puzzle. I think I should have put a 2 where I put the 9. However my strategy was to check each blue square, seeing if either of the numbers in the white boxes would fit there. In each case there was one of the numbers that could only go one place while still leaving a spot for the other number.	2
41	Persistent Solver	0.88	1	Male	59	18	7	TRUE	TRUE	The correct answer is 6. Since I must pick between the two numbers 6 or 3, the only possible answer is 6. The number 3 can be in the current box or the box above while 6 can only be in the given box since 6 is in the 9x9 quadrant below and there is a 6 in the horizon of boxes above.	2
42	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.921875	Female	50	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	I look at the possible solution numbers.  Next I look at each empty cell and ask myself if a possible solution number fits into the empty cell as the correct answer I am looking for.	0
43	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.9375	Female	36	14	5	TRUE	TRUE	I started by looking at the far left blue square, then going up and down the row to see which numbers were in that row (9, 4) so I know that neither 9 or 4 are going to be in that box. I went to the next blue box to the right and looked at the numbers in that row (4). This means that 4 isn't going to be in that box, which means 9 is a potential answer. The three blue squares on the far right aren't going to have either 9 or 4 in them because those numbers are in that set of 9 squares. This leaves the green box as the only place for 4.	2
44	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.890625	Male	23	16	7	TRUE	TRUE	First, I went to check which two numbers not in blue were already in their own box together (7 and 6). I then went to the box on the far left to find which column had a 6 or 7 in it. After seeing the column had only a 6, I figured out that 7 could be put in that column's blue square and the green square. Understanding this, I concluded that the green square would be the only place I could put 6.	2
45	Persistent Solver	0.92	0.984375	Female	32	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	I used process of elimination. I eliminated numbers 1, 8, and 5 because those numbers are on the same row. I eliminated the number 9 because there was a 9 in the second box. That left me with the number 4.	0
46	Persistent Solver	0.84	1	Male	47	14	9	TRUE	TRUE	First, I eliminated the quadrant with both the 3 and the 1 as a means of determining which number to pick.<><>Then I looked at the quadrant with the two empty boxes and mentally interrogated the empty boxes. <><>Since I new that one empty box could not contain a 3 or a 1 as these were both in the row containing the box, I moved on to the other empty box.<><>I reasoned that since the last box had a row containing the 3, I could not eliminate 1 as potentially populating this box. <><>The empty green box then, should contain a 3.	2
47	Persistent Solver	0.88	1	Male	49	18	3	TRUE	TRUE	I look at the numbers that appear more than others all across the board because they're more likely to exclude the required number of cells. The 9 in the upper right square prevents a 9 in the blue cell next to the 3. The 9 in the upper middle square prevents a 9 in the blue cell between 1 &9 and the 9 in the middle left square prevents a 9 in the 3 blue cells it shares a square which means the cell we're trying to figure must be a 9.	2
48	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.953125	Male	27	21	6	TRUE	TRUE	It can't be in the top square, since there is already 9 and 4 in the row. It can't be in the bottom square, since 9 and 4 are already in the square. In fourth line from the top, there is already a 4, so this value must be 9. Therefore the green box must be 4.	2
49	Persistent Solver	0.92	1	Female	36	12	2	TRUE	TRUE	I'm going to refer to each square as a number going from left to right 1,2,3 then the next row from left to right 4,5,6 and lastly the last row from left to right 7,8,9.<><>So after I look at the blue highlighted row I look at the numbers outside of the highlight boxes 1,3 and 8. So I figure I'm probably looking for a 9 or 2 to put in the green box. so I try to eliminate what I can. box 8 cannot have either number so I scratch that off.  I look at box 1 next and see that the first spot in the blue highlight cannot be a 9 or 2 so I scratch that spot off, then I look at box 3 and look over to the blue highlight and see that a 9 and not a 2 can be put there so that only leaves 2 to to be able to be put in the green box.	2
50	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.9375	Female	64	16	2	TRUE	TRUE	I eliminated the first three blue squares because you wouldn't be able to use 7 0r 8 in them because 7 and 8 were already in the box. The fourth blue square I eliminated because there was a 7 and 8 in that row.  The last blue square could have the 7 because only 8 was in that row.  That left 8 for the green square because 7 could be used in the last blue square.	2
51	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.96875	Male	28	16	4	TRUE	TRUE	To solve the puzzle, I first find the grid with three empty blue squares. This grid always has two numbers which are not inside the blue squares. To start, I know that the number I am looking for will be one of these two numbers. I  then find the other empty blue squares in the puzzle. I examine the row/column that each of the remaining blue squares is in. Which ever number appears in each of these rows/columns is the  number I am looking for.	2
52	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.921875	Female	50	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	I eliminated the first 3 boxes in the blue row because 5 & 7 were in the grid of 9 numbers. The 4 eliminates that square for a 5 or 7. The next blue square eliminates 5 & 7 since they are both in the row. The green box is 5 or 7. The next box is already filled with a 9 and the next with an 8. The last blue box can only be 5, So 5 can be in that blue box or the green box, leaving 7 as the number that fits only in the green box.	2
53	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.984375	Male	24	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	So i find the square that had the 7 and 5 already in it I know since that has a 7 and 5 that I can eliminate those 3 blue squares. Then I go to the green square and find which blue square that can't be a 7 or 5 and then i find the blue square that can't be a 5 but can be a 7 so then I know since that blue square would be a 7 our green square would be the 5	2
54	Persistent Solver	0.88	1	Male	35	18	2	TRUE	TRUE	Step 1: Identify the grid with both numbers and ignore. <><>Step 2: Next grid without the green box, identify if a 6 or a 9 can go in either box. The six can not go in either box so that means the 6 must go in the green box.	2
55	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.921875	Female	30	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	Whatever third of the puzzle contained two non-blue numbers, I used those two numbers as a choice. Whichever would fit in a blue square exclusively was right.	0
56	Persistent Solver	0.8	0.953125	Male	39	12	2	TRUE	TRUE	Find the row or column where the blue cell must be one of the two numbers that are present and available as options (6 and 9 in this case).  In this puzzle, the blue cell in the sixth row from the top must be a 4, therefore the answer must be 6.	2
57	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.875	Male	31	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	First, I looked at all of the numbers in the row of the answer needed. Then, I looked if there were any numbers in that column. I then looked at the numbers in the 3x3 square of the answer needed. I tried to work out some of the numbers of the row with the answer and the square to find the number needed.	0
58	Persistent Solver	0.76	0.984375	Male	29	16	3	TRUE	TRUE	1) The first thing I do is to look at a box containing a """"2"""" and a """"6"""" which is the one on the middle right. This is the box I completely ignore.<><>2) I look for a column with a """"2"""" and a """"6"""". This is the blue box I should ignore as well.<><>3) The last open blue box is usually in the same column as the correct answer which is """"2"""" in this case by looking at the column furthest to the left.<><>4) I felt it was easier figuring sudoku out when I find a pattern instead of logically thinking things through.	2
59	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.78125	Male	38	18	8	TRUE	TRUE	saw which number couldn't be elsewhere in the highlighted column	2
60	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.90625	Male	32	12	1	TRUE	FALSE	I found the two """"target"""" numbers which were 8 and 2 and then used deductive reasoning on each empty, blue square. Once I found that one could fit, the other left over number had to be the correct answer.	2
61	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.9375	Female	51	12	3	TRUE	TRUE	I looked for the box with the blue line in it that already had a 6 and 7. So I ignored that box. Then I looked to the left and found that the blank spot there already had a 6 and 7 in the vertical column. So I ignored that box. I then looked to the middle column, so there was a single 6 so a 7 would go to the right of the 8 and the 6 would go to the left.	2
62	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.9375	Female	61	16	2	TRUE	TRUE	I picked one of the two options - in this case the 4.  I typed it in and then checked to see if it could go anywhere else. If not I pressed submit. If 4 could go in any of the other blue boxes, I changed the 4 to the other number - in this case 6. <><>So basically, I picked one and then 'proofed' it.	2
63	Persistent Solver	0.88	0.890625	Female	48	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	I figured out what 2 numbers aren't in the blue row. Then I looked at the empty space columns for the numbers that it can't be. I filled in the spaces from those.	0
64	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.984375	Male	31	12	2	TRUE	TRUE	Eliminated all filled boxes in row, then 3x3 box at middle right, then eliminated bottom right box in middle left and filled left box with 3 which left the only possible answer for green box 7.	2
65	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.984375	Male	40	16	4	TRUE	TRUE	I looked to remove the block with both 5 and 1 which was the first three blues.  Then removed the row with both 5 and 1 (in between the 3 and 9), Then saw the row with 1 which could only match with 5, leaving the green only being able to be the number 1	2
67	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.984375	Female	19	16	4	TRUE	TRUE	First I found the box where I could not put an 8 or a 1 because both numbers were already in that box. This box is in the middle section on the far left. Then i found a column where both 1 and 8 were and ruled out that space. Then I looked at the 7th column from the left which only had an 8 so I know that the number 1 can go there. Therefore the remaining space in this row must be 8.	2
68	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.984375	Female	34	16	8	TRUE	TRUE	First, since I noticed that two numbers were always given as clues, I would figure out which two numbers I'd be seeing fit. Then I'd look at each empty box on the blue line, starting left and going right (or up to down for vertical blue lines). For each box, I'd determine which number couldn't go there. If a number COULD go there, I knew that that wasn't the right answer and that the other number was the answer.	2
69	Persistent Solver	0.8	1	Male	32	14	1	TRUE	FALSE	Looked at the blue line. See 1 in middle right box keeping it safe. Only 1 spot in middle box. 2 spots in middle left box are blocked by 1s coming from upper left and bottom left, therefore I rule that middle box is a 1.	2
70	Persistent Solver	0.8	0.875	Male	41	14	2	TRUE	TRUE	I went through the """"hint"""" numbers in blue and did process of elimination in my head.	0
71	Persistent Solver	0.8	0.90625	Female	54	14	4	TRUE	TRUE	The last 3 squares cant be a 1 or 9 because they already exist in the square of 9. the 4th square cant be a 1 or 9 because they are already in that column.  The 3rd square has to be a 9 because there is already a 1 in that column, so the green square needs to be a 1.	2
72	Persistent Solver	0.76	0.90625	Male	33	16	6	TRUE	TRUE	I need a 1 or a 3.  the box to the mid left had a 1 and 3 in it already so i ruled out those 3 blue squares.  the box on the right middle only had 1 square but the column already had a 1 and 3.  so that means the 1 and the 3 have to be in the center box.  since the top mid box had a 3 in the first column, i knew the 1 had to be in that column, and the 3 in the one to the right of it.	2
73	Persistent Solver	0.72	0.96875	Female	26	14	5	TRUE	TRUE	As a beginner to Sudoku, it was tempting to start solving the puzzle by looking at the bright-colored green box, first. However, over time, I realized that I could win faster by just looking at the other boxes first. Therefore, I began the puzzle by first ignoring the bright-colored green box. First, I decided to start with the blue box on the far left. I asked myself - """"Can the number 9 go in this box?"""" The answer was automatically """"no,"""" because there was already a number 9 in the row/column/box. Then, I asked myself the same question, for the following blue boxes. And if the answer was """"no"""" for each of the empty blue boxes, then I automatically knew that the only place left for the number 9, was the bright green box. This method was quicker for me, because I didn't even have to pay attention to the other number. However, if the answer to the question """"Can a nine fit in this blue box?"""" had ever been """"Yes,"""" then I would have come to the conclusion that 9 was not the answer.	2
74	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.90625	Male	39	16	7	TRUE	TRUE	The first thing I did was locate the square section that contains both of the possible numbers and the three empty blue squares. After locating this section, I can completely ignore this area since it is irrelevant to finding the answer now. Next I look for either of the two possible numbers (in this case 2 or 3) which is isolated, in a row or column all by itself. Upon finding that number, I'm finished. Just take that number, and since you know that its counterpart will be filled in in the blue row, you can just take the isolated number and make it your answer.	2
75	Persistent Solver	0.84	0.890625	Female	30	16	4	TRUE	TRUE	I looked at the provided numbers outside the blue highlighted row. I figured it had to be either a 2 or a 3 in the green box. Then saw it was possible for 2 to go in 2 places on the row, but the green area was the only place possible for 3.	2
76	Persistent Solver	0.8	0.828125	Male	23	16	8	TRUE	TRUE	At this point in the experiment I have already found the patterns that indicate whether the answer might be right or wrong. There's comes a time when you automate the process of solving the puzzle. I usually ignore the portion of the puzzle that contains the relevant numbers. I then look at the spaces on the highlighted in blue row and start eliminating the possibilities. It is true that the answer is usually the number that's by itself in a given row.	1
77	Persistent Solver	0.8	0.96875	Male	20	16	5	TRUE	TRUE	I find that process of elimination works best for these isolated problems at least. I started on the left and saw that there was a two and a seven in the 3x3 box on the middle left. I knew it was going to be one of those based off of the numbers already in the row. I finished up by looking to the right side and saw that 7 couldn't be placed in either square so it had to be that.	2
78	Persistent Solver	0.76	0.859375	Female	31	12	4	TRUE	TRUE	I knew the answer had to be a 6 or 8. I first looked at the empty squares in the highlighted blue column. Then, I looked at the top three squares in that column. Since there's a 6 and 8 in that 3x3 area, I knew I couldn't check those top 3 squares for a 6 or 8. Since the next 3 squares all had numbers, I focused on the bottom 3. There were 2 empty squares. I noticed that there was a 6 in the row of the first square. That meant that that square would have to be an 8 since you can't have two of the same number in the same row.	2
79	Persistent Solver	0.72	0.96875	Female	31	18	2	TRUE	TRUE	1) Numbers that appear the most are 5 and 3, so I have to put either number 5 or 3 on the square with green color<><>2) Since each large square contains the number 1-9, I looked for the square that already have the number 3 and 5 and eliminate that large square (which is located at the first column of large squares)<><>3) The number 5 and 3 possibly located at the second or third column<><>4) I look at the third large square column and it's impossible because the only blank space has 5 and 3 and in a small column there can only be each one 5 and one 3. so the third large column is eliminated<><>5) The only possible location now for 5 and 3 is the second large column.<><>6) in the second large column, the first small column already have number 3 on it, so we can only put number 5 on the blue square<><>7) So the answer for the green square is 3	2

It did not give me information about solving for 2 or 7 so I moved to the top square.  2.  Top square said I could not use a 2 or 7 (already in the box).  3.  Moved to the middle square.  7 was already in a row, so it could be 2.  Thus, I chose 7.  To be honest, I hate this game.  I'm old and and never play games (not that old, plenty of people my age play games.  But I never do.  Anyway, that is my strategy and it worked.  So, I kept it up throughout the game.	2
