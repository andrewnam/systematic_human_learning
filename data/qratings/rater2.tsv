Irrelevant basis for choice	E. Explicit guess	Response starts out by presenting a deterministic strategy that uses an irrelevant basis for choice, but concludes by claiming that "mostly I choose randomly", so it seems a bit contradictory. Also, my answer to the PD question is based on the reference to "lowest" and "higher" number.

7	00d893	Correct	Correct	Correct	As a beginner to Sudoku, it was tempting to start solving the puzzle by looking at the bright-colored green box, first. However, over time, I realized that I could win faster by just looking at the other boxes first. Therefore, I began the puzzle by first ignoring the bright-colored green box. First, I decided to start with the blue box on the far left. I asked myself - "Can the number 9 go in this box?" The answer was automatically "no," because there was already a number 9 in the row/column/box. Then, I asked myself the same question, for the following blue boxes. And if the answer was "no" for each of the empty blue boxes, then I automatically knew that the only place left for the number 9, was the bright green box. This method was quicker for me, because I didn't even have to pay attention to the other number. However, if the answer to the question "Can a nine fit in this blue box?" had ever been "Yes," then I would have come to the conclusion that 9 was not the answer.

Chose digit that cannot go elsewhere	B. One PD can go elsewhere, chose the other	Response seems to imply that they were ready to use basis B, depending on what they concluded about the first candidate answer, although this isn't made explicit. This is because they make reference to "the other number", and in the last sentence, describe the thought that they might not have chosen 9 under certain conditions. Whether this means they would have chosen "the other number" is unclear but plausible, hence B as second choice.

I first identified the 3x3 square that contained two numbers outside of the blue-shaded row. I noted that these numbers were 2 and 3, and then I looked for their locations in rows that:    1) didn't cross that same 3x3 square  2) didn't contain numbers in their blue-shaded square.  3) Didn't include the green/yellow target square    There were two rows matching this description. Of these two rows, I identified the one that contained only one number. This number was 2. I therefore entered 2 in the target square.	Both		C.

I try to find the blue cell which would allow either a 1 or a 7, in order to single out which remaining number belongs in the green cell.

Found cell where one PD could go and the other could not	Same comment as for subject 136: Would have to also specify that the row/column found must not intersect the blue line at a 3x3 grid which contains other non-blue numbers (e.g. 8th column in this case), hence, D. But otherwise, this seems to be basis C.

151	e2f2a2	Correct	Correct	Correct	I know the correct answer has to be 6 or 2, so I need to eliminate one of those numbers. I first eliminate the 3X3 square that has both the 6 and the 2 inside of it and that same 3X3 square is part of the highlighted row. Then I simply check the other 2 columns to see if either the 6 or 2 is in one or both of those rows. Since the 2 is already taken in 2 of the rows, the only other place to put a 2 is in my row. I hope that explains it.	I know the correct answer has to be 6 or 2, so I need to eliminate one of those numbers.

152	1d142c	Correct	Correct	Correct	At this point in the experiment I have already found the patterns that indicate whether the answer might be right or wrong. There's comes a time when you automate the process of solving the puzzle. I usually ignore the portion of the puzzle that contains the relevant numbers. I then look at the spaces on the highlighted in blue row and start eliminating the possibilities. It is true that the answer is usually the number that's by itself in a given row.

Potentially valid but general or not fully specified		To be clear: just looking at which number is alone in a row does not give the answer, as this is the case for the third column from the left as well (which has only 8). But since the subject says "usually" and not "always", I'm not taking an issue with that, and so I'm assigning basis D based on the second-to-last sentence of the answer.

161	d535b1	Correct	Correct	Correct	In the blue column, the bottom three blocks are within a 3x3 blocks having 1 and 8, so these bottom 3 blocks can't be 1 or 8. In the middle three blue blocks, the bottom block is in a line having 1 and 8, so it can't be 1 or 8. In the top three blue blocks, there is a line with 1. Thus, the middle block in the middle three blocks should be 1. I use the way to exclude blocks and find out which block should be exclusive for 1 or 8.

162	e20d70	Correct	Correct	Correct	I knew the answer had to be a 6 or 8. I first looked at the empty squares in the highlighted blue column. Then, I looked at the top three squares in that column. Since there's a 6 and 8 in that 3x3 area, I knew I couldn't check those top 3 squares for a 6 or 8. Since the next 3 squares all had numbers, I focused on the bottom 3. There were 2 empty squares. I noticed that there was a 6 in the row of the first square. That meant that that square would have to be an 8 since you can't have two of the same number in the same row.

164	3d2616	Correct	Correct	Correct	I saw that there was a 4 and 8 in the bottom middle grid. This let me know that those were two numbers i was interested in, since they eliminated themselves from contention for the column in question. I then looked at the non eliminated boxes in the column and checked to see if they were also eliminated by an 8 or 4 in their row. You can see that the top bow in our row is eliminated by the 8 to its left, meaning that box could still be a 4. The second empty box is eliminated by both 8 on the left and 4 on the right, it cant be either of those numbers. Since the last 3 boxes in our column are eliminated by the 4 and 8 in that grid, it leaves only one space available left for the 8 to go in our column.
