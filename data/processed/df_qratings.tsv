2	167	TRUE	rater1	TRUE	TRUE	Both	NA	TRUE	Valid	V2	NA	I first found the 3x3 box with the numbers 9 and 8 and eliminated those blue boxes because neither of those numbers could be used again there. Then, I found the column between the numbers 7 and 4 and eliminated the blue box because the column contained 9 and 8. Finally, from the two columns left, I concluded that the blue box that shared the column with an 8 must be 9. So then, the remaining box must be 8.

This let me know that those were two numbers i was interested in, since they eliminated themselves from contention for the column in question. I then looked at the non eliminated boxes in the column and checked to see if they were also eliminated by an 8 or 4 in their row. You can see that the top bow in our row is eliminated by the 8 to its left, meaning that box could still be a 4. The second empty box is eliminated by both 8 on the left and 4 on the right, it cant be either of those numbers. Since the last 3 boxes in our column are eliminated by the 4 and 8 in that grid, it leaves only one space available left for the 8 to go in our column.

First, I noted that the answer had to be 2 or 7, because these are the numbers appearing outside this column. Second, I asked whether the 2 could go anywhere else in the column than in the box of interest, and saw or started to see that it could not. Next, I checked my intuition that 2 was the correct answer by verifying that the 7 could go in at least two places in the row, i.e. in the box of interest or in the next available box (below the 6), which indeed proved to be the case, thus verifying that the answer had to be 2.

As a beginner to Sudoku, it was tempting to start solving the puzzle by looking at the bright-colored green box, first. However, over time, I realized that I could win faster by just looking at the other boxes first. Therefore, I began the puzzle by first ignoring the bright-colored green box. First, I decided to start with the blue box on the far left. I asked myself - """"Can the number 9 go in this box?"""" The answer was automatically """"no,"""" because there was already a number 9 in the row/column/box. Then, I asked myself the same question, for the following blue boxes. And if the answer was """"no"""" for each of the empty blue boxes, then I automatically knew that the only place left for the number 9, was the bright green box. This method was quicker for me, because I didn't even have to pay attention to the other number. However, if the answer to the question """"Can a nine fit in this blue box?"""" had ever been """"Yes,"""" then I would have come to the conclusion that 9 was not the answer.

This is because they make reference to ""the other number"", and in the last sentence, describe the thought that they might not have chosen 9 under certain conditions. Whether this means they would have chosen ""the other number"" is unclear but plausible, hence B as second choice.
