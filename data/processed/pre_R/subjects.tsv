I then looked for the one line in which there was only one number with a an empty blue space (there is a line like this in every puzzle). In this puzzle it was 2, so I know the blue blank must be three. That means the green blank space must be 2. In many of the puzzles, I simply looked for this number and filled in the blank. To be clear, I did not rest on this strategy at first, but after so many puzzles, I was able to figure out a short cut to get to the end. Hope this helps. Best of luck on the research. 	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	The 2 in the middle column. This told me that the green blank must be 2.

And because the box in the middle of the left side also contains a 4, that meant the blue box of that same row could be a 7. Thus, the answer was 4.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	There were more than one 9 unit boxes with 7 and 4 in them, thus eliminating those blue squares in the boxes. From there it was easy to figure out.	['distractorDouble', 'targetDouble', 'targetSingle']	Because the left side had both 7 and 4, I was able to look at the right side and see the 4 in the same row as the 7 on the left side. From there, I looked at the 4 on the left side and could see that 7 was a possibility in the blue square of that row. Thus the answer became clear that it was 4.	No, I just submitted my original guess without checking any further.			I feel my responses are clear and easy to understand.	column	ca04a1

I then looked for the open spaces in the columns and followed each row and noticed which ones where blocked by two numbers. I then looked at the last space that was not green and saw that it was blocked by a 2. The green space was the only space to put a 2 so that is the answer.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	I noticed the bottom square was completely blocked and that there was more twos in the unblocked rows than fours.	['targetBox', 'distractorBox', 'distractorSingle']	They blocked the bottom three cells of the column and the extra 4 blocked an already blocked column	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I checked the two open spaces in the column that were not green for which number blocked them.	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	I believe my responses described my  process thoroughly.	column	a43819

['distractorSingle']	I might have misunderstood the last question. I apologize. I honestly went in looking to do my process of elimination technique over looking around the board for clues.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I used process of elimination in all the open blue squares and those perpendicular to them. 	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	"I chose the far left as a starting point and thought in my head ""these three cannot be a two or a seven"". After that I looked at the green square and thought in my head ""This could be a two or a seven"".  I then went to the blue square to the right of the four and saw that it could be two, but it couldn't be a seven. To make sure that it was a seven I looked to the last blue square(If you are starting from the left) and recognized that that could not be a seven as well. This affirmed the answer."	row	bd0c0b

In the middle three blue blocks, the bottom block is in a line having 1 and 8, so it can't be 1 or 8. In the top three blue blocks, there is a line with 1. Thus, the middle block in the middle three blocks should be 1. I use the way to exclude blocks and find out which block should be exclusive for 1 or 8.

I checked the numbers in other lines and cells, to make sure which candidate is correct.

After locating this section, I can completely ignore this area since it is irrelevant to finding the answer now. Next I look for either of the two possible numbers (in this case 2 or 3) which is isolated, in a row or column all by itself. Upon finding that number, I'm finished. Just take that number, and since you know that its counterpart will be filled in in the blue row, you can just take the isolated number and make it your answer. 	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	I noticed that in every instance there will be rows or columns where the candidate numbers are isolated with no other numbers in said column or row. Then I figured out that the section that contains both numbers can be ignored. This left only one of the candidates in an isolated column or row relative to the blue line / what I was trying to figure out, thus giving me my answer. 	['distractorBox', 'targetBox', 'targetSingle']	I recognize here that the 2 and 3 that I highlighted that are right next to each other will make the three blue squares above it impossible to be a 2 or 3. Then I find my isolated 2 that I highlighted, and since i know that under that there can be no 2, I know that 2 will be my correct answer.	No, I just submitted my original guess without checking any further.			So one more time. I realized that once I could find an isolated candidate relative to either the horizontal or vertical orientation of the blue line, that that isolated candidate HAD to be my correct answer since in every instance there was only one isolated candidate (other than the area that had the two candidates both contained within it).	row	f704f1

['distractorSingle']	The number 4 was appearing in the column that already had the number eight made me realize that it was appearing without the number 7, but it appeared with another number already filling in the blue box. 	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I doubled checked that their was no way that the answer could be 4 buy eliminating all other possibilities. 	I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	I first start by looking at the numbers that appear in the same set of squares so that I can eliminate those three boxes first. Then I eliminate the columns that have both numbers in them. 	row	e41709

2) Since each large square contains the number 1-9, I looked for the square that already have the number 3 and 5 and eliminate that large square (which is located at the first column of large squares)

3) The number 5 and 3 possibly located at the second or third column

4) I look at the third large square column and it's impossible because the only blank space has 5 and 3 and in a small column there can only be each one 5 and one 3. so the third large column is eliminated

5) The only possible location now for 5 and 3 is the second large column.

6) in the second large column, the first small column already have number 3 on it, so we can only put number 5 on the blue square

7) So the answer for the green square is 3"	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.

I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	there can only be one 3 and one 5 in a column so you can't put another 3 in the column that already has 3 in it. 	row	11ab9d

This eliminates both numbers from the bottom three blue shaded squares. Then I identify the row that contains both numbers (in this case the fourth row from the bottom). This eliminates both numbers from the fourth blue shaded box from the bottom. Then I can eliminate the top blue shaded box from containing a 6, because it is already contained in that top row. This leaves only one shaded blue box remaining where the 6 must be located. 	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	The row that containing the single number that cannot be immediately eliminated.

The row with one digit eliminated the other digit so that is how I came to the solution.	['emptyBox', 'emptyBox', 'emptyBox', 'emptySingle']	I eliminated the row in the 9 x 9 square entirely.

Then I looked at the quadrant with the two empty boxes and mentally interrogated the empty boxes. 

Since I new that one empty box could not contain a 3 or a 1 as these were both in the row containing the box, I moved on to the other empty box.

I reasoned that since the last box had a row containing the 3, I could not eliminate 1 as potentially populating this box. 

The empty green box then, should contain a 3."	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.

I then moved on to the quadrant without the green box to eliminate   other choices.  The row containing 1 and 3 told me that neither of these could be vales here.

My first step involves finding the 3x3 grid which eliminates both numbers (in this case 7 and 1) from all 3 of it's blue cells. In this case it is the top-most grid.

2. After eliminating these 3 cells, I check to see if any rows have both a 1 and 7 on them, thereby eliminating the number from the corresponding blue cell entirely. In this case I am able to eliminate the cell in the row which is fourth from the top.

3. I locate the remaining possible cells. Narrowing my choices makes it easier to choose. I try to find the blue cell which would allow either a 1 or a 7, in order to single out which remaining number belongs in the green cell. I find that a 1 can be placed in the bottom row, but it is already filled. The cell just above the 6 is the only blue cell which could have a 1 or a 7, only there is a 1 in it's row, so I must put in a 7.

4. After eliminating the 7 I know that the only number which can be placed in the green cell is a 1."	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	The only blue cell which would fit one of the two numbers, could only fit a 7 due to there already being a 1 in that row.	['emptySingle']	Only a 7 could be fit into this cell, leaving only one remaining place where a 1 could be placed (the green cell).	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I would give a quick survey of the entire grid, just to confirm that I had made no mistakes, and that I had eliminated the correct number.	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	My main strategy involved making sure that I was able to accurately place a number in the blue cell, thereby creating only one possible solution to the green cell. I used the process of elimination, more or less.	column	40d83c

1) didn't cross that same 3x3 square
2) didn't contain numbers in their blue-shaded square.
3) Didn't include the green/yellow target square

There were two rows matching this description. Of these two rows, I identified the one that contained only one number. This number was  2. I therefore entered 2 in the target square.
"	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	Excluding the 3x3 containing both possible numbers, there was only one row that contained only one of the possible numbers.	['targetSingle']	When a row like this exists, containing only one of the possible numbers (e.g. 2), that excludes the other number (e.g. 3) from consideration, because it means that 3 *could* be used in that row's blue-shaded square.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I followed the process described in my first open-ended answer. I first identified the 3x3 containing both possible numbers, then I went back to the other rows, which I had already noticed. I'm not sure if this was necessary to do, but it's the process I built up by habit while doing the puzzles.	I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	I basically developed kind of decision-making habit that allowed me to observe patterns over the course of the main puzzle task. Even when this failed, which happened twice, I was able to recognize what I had done wrong and refine the process. Once I had repeated this process for awhile, I felt very confident answering the puzzles.	column	89b7d6

I checked that there wasn't number 8 in that other row so there were  two  options where number 8 could  be so the correct answer had to be 4.	I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	N/A	column	d1dfe3

I mentally noted that the 3 x 3 block with those two numbers already there could not contain another 3 or 4. I looked to the next column that I 3 or 4 could belong in. I noticed that a 4 could exist in that column but a 3 could not. That made me realize that 3 belonged in the green box.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	I noticed that 4 could fit in another position within the row but 3 could not.	['targetSingle']	It made 3 seem correct because that cell indicates that another 3 cannot exist in that column, but a 4 could.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I checked to see if that candidate could fit into another column.	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	I solved the puzzle by ignoring the box that had a 4 and a 3 in them because no other 4 or 3 could exist in that 3 x 3 box. I then looked to see if a 4 four could exist some place on the row. I realized that there was a place for it within the row. That's when I realized that 3 was the correct answer.	row	09a6b1

The 9 in the upper right square prevents a 9 in the blue cell next to the 3. The 9 in the upper middle square prevents a 9 in the blue cell between 1 &9 and the 9 in the middle left square prevents a 9 in the 3 blue cells it shares a square which means the cell we're trying to figure must be a 9.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	I noticed 3 9s and 3 2s. Next I excluded the 2s since a 2 can be either in the blue cell in the middle right square or the cell we're trying to figure out.	['targetDouble', 'targetSingle', 'targetBox', 'distractorDouble', 'distractorSingle', 'distractorBox']	There are more 9s and 2s than other numbers giving them a high probability of excluding the required number of cells.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	By excluding the 2 as explained in a previous answer and then examining whether a 9 can be in any other blue cell. 	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	It was easy to see one 9 excludes 3 blue cells and 2 other 9s exclude another 2 which leaves only 1.	row	72a302

Second, I asked whether the 2 could go anywhere else in the column than in the box of interest, and saw or started to see that it could not. Next, I checked my intuition that 2 was the correct answer by verifying that the 7 could go in at least two places in the row, i.e. in the box of interest or in the next available box (below the 6), which indeed proved to be the case, thus verifying that the answer had to be 2. 	I arbitrarily chose between the two candidates because they seemed equally promising to consider.		['targetDouble', 'targetSingle', 'targetBox', 'distractorDouble', 'distractorSingle', 'distractorBox']					I did sense vaguely at times in the previous section something that, while receding from awareness but that no doubt remained true in my approach to this puzzle -- namely that I was not necessarily working on the puzzle in the most efficient manner. One thing I noted at times but didn't fully figure out the possible utility of is the fact that information relevant to choosing between the two possible answers often seemed available just by confining my attention to the three rows corresponding to the 3x3 box in which the box of interest appeared. This narrow a focus may not always be sufficient to indicate the answer -- I haven't figured that out yet. But I do sense there's likely a more efficient approach than the one I've been tending to use.	column	7bbbeb

I then went to the box on the far left to find which column had a 6 or 7 in it. After seeing the column had only a 6, I figured out that 7 could be put in that column's blue square and the green square. Understanding this, I concluded that the green square would be the only place I could put 6.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	The number 6 was isolated in a column and in a box that didn't contain a 6 or 7.	['targetSingle', 'emptySingle']	They were isolated in their own column, and unlike the 7 in the third to last column, this column didn't go through a section with both 6 and 7 in it. 	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I proofread what the new puzzle looked like to cross-check, making sure my work was correct. 	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	Once I found the box section with both 6 and 7, I automatically ignored that section. This made the process go by much quicker. 	row	9ea0ec

In the first cell and the second cell I see that 5 is unable to go there cause it would be redundant across the row. Moving on the columns are already filled with 2, 4, 5, and 6 so I don't need to worry about those. Then I know that the box at the bottom middle cannot contain any more 9 and 5's. So the only place that leaves to input 5 is the green box.	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	"Well the candidate that was more likely to be the answer was when there was a number alone across the field of interest. If that number was alone then I knew that the other different number could be put there only leaving the redundant number to be the right answer.

For example, the 5 in the 3rd quadrant made it impossible to put a 5 there so it gave me an idea that it could only be put in the green box eliminating the other choices."	['targetSingle']	Like I explained before inputting the same number across either the row or column would mean it is redundant and wrong so that kind of reserves that area then for another number leaving us the only option being that redundant number.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I just double checked my process of elimination to see if my number of interest could be put in other slots. If not and the only area was the green highlighted area then that means that is the only correct spot it could be slotted in.	I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	Basically to sum it up it was all in the process of elimination. Looking at the numbers across to eliminate some highlighted spots. And then using the 3 x 3 boxes to eliminate 3 rows or columns finally leaving only one slot for one number.	column	407610

This let me know that those were two numbers i was interested in, since they eliminated themselves from contention for the column in question. I then looked at the non eliminated boxes in the column and checked to see if they were also eliminated by an 8 or 4 in their row. You can see that the top bow in our row is eliminated by the 8 to its left, meaning that box could still be a 4. The second empty box is eliminated by both 8 on the left and 4 on the right, it cant be either of those numbers. Since the last 3 boxes in our column are eliminated by the 4 and 8 in that grid, it leaves only one space available left for the 8 to go in our column. 	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	I noticed that the number 8 was eliminated in more places than the 4 in the column in question. There is a 4 in the top left grid that does not eliminate any square in our target column.	['distractorSingle', 'targetSingle']	The 8 in the top left grid eliminated a box in our target column, while the 4 in the top left grid does not interact with our column in a meaningful way.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	Once i thought it was an 8 I went through and used the other 8's available to eliminate there being any other place that the 8 could go.	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	The key for me was to see that the number 8 was eliminated in all other candidate squares in the column in question.	column	3d2616

I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.

I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.

Second, I couldn't put either number in the blue space below the 6. I could put number 7 in the topmost blue space, because the 2 in that row wouldn't prevent me from doing so. So I should put 2 in the only remaining possible blue space (between the 3 and the 6).	I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	It seemed that often in these puzzles the number that was by itself in a row/column was likely the correct option. My eye was drawn to the two in the upper right corner in this regard.	['targetSingle']	As I explained in the previous question, numbers alone in a row (that is, a row that also contains a blank blue space) were often the correct option. In this case, the 2 I highlighted fulfills this criterion.	Yes, I checked to see whether the candidate was actually correct.	I knew that the bottom four blue spaces must remain blank. I then looked at the top blue space and saw that putting a 2 there would not be possible. So I was left with putting the 2 in the green space.	I checked whether the candidate I chose could go in any of the empty blue cells in the row/column.	I feel that I have fully explained my though process in the previous questions.	column	791f2f

I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	The 3s were all placed strategically.

I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.	It's hard to explain but when I saw the numbers, I was just able to visualize what the correct number was, like there is a solution in my mind, but I can't quite grasp what it is, even though subconsciously it's appearing to me.

I noticed something in the puzzle that initially made one candidate seem more likely to be correct than the other.

2) I look for a column with a ""2"" and a ""6"". This is the blue box I should ignore as well.

3) The last open blue box is usually in the same column as the correct answer which is ""2"" in this case by looking at the column furthest to the left.

4) I felt it was easier figuring sudoku out when I find a pattern instead of logically thinking things through.

"The candidate that is usually more correct is usually the other number in the same column as the blue box. In this situation, it would be ""2"" because it is the other number.

I looked at other numbers in the puzzle until I noticed something that helped me decide whether or not the candidate was correct.	I mostly developed a system of patterns that I can follow to quickly solve the puzzle without thinking too hard. I felt that thinking too hard made the puzzle more difficult than it is.
