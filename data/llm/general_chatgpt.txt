>>> What is Sudoku?

<<< Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. It typically consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 sub-grids, with some of the cells already filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal of the puzzle is to fill in the remaining empty cells in such a way that every row, column, and sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once.
The difficulty of Sudoku puzzles can vary, with some being relatively easy and others requiring more advanced logic and reasoning skills to solve. Sudoku has become a popular pastime around the world, with numerous books, magazines, and online resources dedicated to the puzzle.

>>> What is the Hidden Single technique in Sudoku?

<<< The Hidden Single technique is a solving method used in Sudoku puzzles to identify a number that can only appear once in a particular row, column, or box. Unlike the Naked Single technique, which involves identifying cells with only one possible candidate value, the Hidden Single technique involves identifying a candidate value that can only appear in one cell in a particular row, column, or box.

To use the Hidden Single technique, you need to identify a candidate value that appears only once in a particular row, column, or box. This means that the candidate value must not appear in any other cell in that particular row, column, or box. Once you have identified a Hidden Single, you can then eliminate all other candidate values from the corresponding cell, since you know that the Hidden Single must be the correct value.

For example, in the image below, the highlighted cell in the middle column can only be a 5, since 5 does not appear in any of the other cells in that column or in the middle box. Therefore, you can eliminate all other candidate values from that cell.

Session 3 - Correct

>>> Here are the contents of a 9 by 9 grid.

(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 8.
(row 3, column 7) contains 7.
(row 4, column 7) contains 4.
(row 5, column 7) contains 1.
(row 6, column 7) contains 3.
(row 7, column 7) contains 2.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

Where is the 1 located?

<<< According to the given information, the 1 is located in row 5, column 7 of the 9 by 9 grid.

Session 4 - Correct

>>> Sudoku is a puzzle with a 9x9 grid of numbers where each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain exactly one of each number from 1 to 9.

Assume you have a grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 7.
(row 3, column 7) contains 8.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 5, column 7) contains 1.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 7) contains 1.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

Column 7 does not contain every number between 1 and 9, but rather contains two copies of the digit 1, forming a contradiction. Which two cells create this contradiction?

<<< The two cells that create the contradiction in column 7 are:

(row 5, column 7) contains 1.
(row 7, column 7) contains 1.
As per the rules of Sudoku, each column must contain exactly one of each number from 1 to 9. However, in column 7, there are two cells that contain the digit 1 (in rows 5 and 7), which violates this rule and creates a contradiction. Therefore, the puzzle is not valid.

Session 5

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 7.
(row 3, column 7) contains 8.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 7) contains 1.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

What number should now go in (row 5, column 7) so that the column contains every number between 1 and 9?

<<< To make sure that every number between 1 and 9 appears once in column 7, we need to find the missing number between 1 and 9 in that column. We know that 6, 7, 8, 2, 4, 1, 5, and 9 are already in the column, so the missing number is 3. Therefore, the number that should go in (row 5, column 7) is 3.

Session 6 - Confused, but correct

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Where is the 3 that is preventing (row 9, column 7) from being a 3?

<<< Based on the information given, there is no 3 that is preventing (row 9, column 7) from being a 3. In fact, there is no information given that is directly related to the value of (row 9, column 7).

However, we can use the rules of Sudoku to eliminate some possibilities for the value of (row 9, column 7). For example, since (row 9, column 6) contains a 3, we know that (row 9, column 7) cannot also be a 3, since no row, column, or 3x3 subgrid can contain two identical numbers.

Similarly, we can look at the other rows, columns, and subgrids to eliminate other possibilities for the value of (row 9, column 7). By applying these rules systematically, we can eventually determine the value of (row 9, column 7) and complete the Sudoku grid.

Session 7 - Confused, but correct

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Where is the 3 that is preventing (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) from being a 3?

<<< Based on the rules of Sudoku, each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid can only contain the numbers 1 to 9 once.

Given that (row 1, column 8) contains 3, we know that there cannot be another 3 in the same row (row 1) or the same 3x3 sub-grid that contains (row 1, column 8).

We also know that (row 7, column 2) contains 3, which means there cannot be another 3 in the same column (column 2) or the same 3x3 sub-grid that contains (row 7, column 2).

Therefore, the only remaining possibility for the 3 that is preventing (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) from being a 3 is that it must be in the same 3x3 sub-grid that contains (row 6, column 7), since this is the only 3x3 sub-grid that intersects with all three of those cells.

To summarize, the 3 that is preventing (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) from being a 3 must be located in the same 3x3 sub-grid as (row 6, column 7), and cannot be in any of the other cells that are in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid as (row 1, column 8) or (row 7, column 2).

Session 8 - Incorrect, begins correct but incorrect conclusion

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Can (row 1, column 7) contain a 3?

<<< Based on the rules of Sudoku, each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. Therefore, we need to check if the number 3 already appears in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid as the cell in question (row 1, column 7).

Checking the row: We know that (row 1, column 8) contains a 3, so (row 1, column 7) cannot contain a 3.

Checking the column: We do not have any information about column 7, so we cannot rule out the possibility that (row 1, column 7) contains a 3.

Checking the 3x3 subgrid: The cell (row 1, column 7) belongs to the same 3x3 subgrid as (row 1, column 8) and (row 2, column 8). We do not have any information about the numbers in this subgrid, so we cannot rule out the possibility that (row 1, column 7) contains a 3.

Therefore, it is possible that (row 1, column 7) contains a 3.

Session 9 - Incorrect and confused

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Can (row 2, column 7) contain a 3?

<<< We need to check whether the number 3 appears in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid as the cell (row 2, column 7).

Checking the row: We can see that the number 3 already appears in row 1 and row 9, so it is not possible for (row 2, column 7) to contain a 3.

Checking the column: The number 3 appears in column 2, but not in column 7. Therefore, it is still possible for (row 2, column 7) to contain a 3.

Checking the 3x3 subgrid: The cell (row 2, column 7) belongs to the same 3x3 subgrid as (row 1, column 9), (row 1, column 8), (row 3, column 9), and (row 3, column 8). None of these cells contain a 3, so it is possible for (row 2, column 7) to contain a 3.

Therefore, it is still possible for (row 2, column 7) to contain a 3.

Using the Hidden Single technique along column 7, find the number that goes into (row 5, column 7).

Session 10 - Correct, but with one incorrect statement

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Can (row 7, column 7) contain a 3?

<<< To determine whether (row 7, column 7) can contain a 3, we need to check whether a 3 already exists in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

First, let's examine the same row (row 7). There is already a 3 in column 2, so (row 7, column 7) cannot contain a 3.

Next, let's examine the same column (column 7). There is already a 2 in row 4, a 4 in row 6, and a 5 in row 8, but none of these numbers conflict with a 3. So, it is possible that (row 7, column 7) can contain a 3.

Finally, let's examine the same 3x3 subgrid that contains (row 7, column 7). This is the bottom-right subgrid. Looking at this subgrid, we see that there is already a 3 in row 9 column 6, so (row 7, column 7) cannot contain a 3.

Therefore, based on the numbers already in the Sudoku grid, (row 7, column 7) cannot contain a 3.
