Session 1 - Correct

>>> What is Sudoku?

<<< Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Session 2 - Correct

>>> What is the Hidden Single technique in Sudoku?

<<< The Hidden Single technique in Sudoku is a strategy used to solve puzzles by looking for a number that can only appear in one cell within a row, column, or box. This number can then be entered into the cell, eliminating the need to try other possibilities.

Session 3 - Correct

>>> Here are the contents of a 9 by 9 grid.

(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 8.
(row 3, column 7) contains 7.
(row 4, column 7) contains 4.
(row 5, column 7) contains 1.
(row 6, column 7) contains 3.
(row 7, column 7) contains 2.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

Where is the 1 located?

<<< The 1 is located in row 5, column 7.

Session 4 - Correct

>>> Sudoku is a puzzle with a 9x9 grid of numbers where each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain exactly one of each number from 1 to 9.

Assume you have a grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 7.
(row 3, column 7) contains 8.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 5, column 7) contains 1.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 7) contains 1.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

Column 7 does not contain every number between 1 and 9, but rather contains two copies of the digit 1, forming a contradiction. Which two cells create this contradiction?

<<< The cells that create the contradiction are (row 5, column 7) and (row 7, column 7), which both contain the digit 1.

Session 5

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 7) contains 6.
(row 2, column 7) contains 7.
(row 3, column 7) contains 8.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 7) contains 1.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 7) contains 9.

What number should now go in (row 5, column 7) so that the column contains every number between 1 and 9?

<<< 3

Session 6 - Correct

>>> Assume you have a Sudoku grid with the following numbers.
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.

Where is the 3 that is preventing (row 9, column 7) from being a 3?

<<< The 3 that is preventing (row 9, column 7) from being a 3 is located in (row 9, column 6).

Session 7 - Incorrect

I am a highly intelligent mathematician and puzzle solver.
Q: Given a Sudoku grid with the following numbers, where is the 3 that is preventing (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) from containing a 3?
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.
A: The 3 is located in (row 5, column 7). The 3 that is preventing (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) from containing a 3 is located in (row 7, column 2).

Session 8 - Correct

I am a highly intelligent mathematician and puzzle solver.
Q: Given a Sudoku grid with the following numbers, can (row 1, column 7) contain a 3?
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.
A: No, (row 1, column 7) cannot contain a 3 since it would create a conflict with the 3 already in (row 1, column 8).

Session 9 - Correct

I am a highly intelligent mathematician and puzzle solver.
Q: In a Sudoku grid containing the following numbers, can (row 2, column 7) contain a 3?
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.
A: No, (row 2, column 7) cannot contain a 3, as that would violate the rule of Sudoku that every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Session 10 - Incorrect

I am a highly intelligent mathematician and puzzle solver.
Q: In a Sudoku grid containing the following numbers, can (row 7, column 7) contain a 3?
(row 1, column 8) contains 3.
(row 4, column 7) contains 2.
(row 6, column 7) contains 4.
(row 7, column 2) contains 3.
(row 8, column 7) contains 5.
(row 9, column 6) contains 3.
A: Yes, (row 7, column 7) can contain a 3.
