(row 8, column 1) contains 9
(row 2, column 5) contains 5
(row 9, column 1) contains 1
(row 7, column 1) contains 7

(row 2, column 8) contains 6
(row 4, column 9) contains 6
What number must (row 1, column 1) contain?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column 1.
A: To solve for (row 1, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 5 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 5 cannot go in (row 8, column 1), (row 9, column 1), or (row 7, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 1), (row 5, column 1), and (row 6, column 1) cannot contain 5 because they share a 3x3 box with 5 in (row 6, column 2). (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 3, column 8), and (row 2, column 1) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 2, column 5). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 5, we can conclude that (row 1, column 1) must contain the 5.

A: To solve for (row 4, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 9 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 9, column 1), (row 6, column 1), or (row 5, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), and (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 1, column 2). (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 7, column 8). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 1) or (row 8, column 1) from containing 9, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 6 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 1 that can contain 6 is (row 4, column 1), so we can conclude that the answer is 6.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row 4.
A: To solve for (row 4, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 4, column 9), (row 4, column 2), or (row 4, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 4), (row 4, column 5), and (row 4, column 6) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 6, column 6). (row 4, column 1) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 7, column 1). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 8) or (row 4, column 3) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 5 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 4 that can contain 5 is (row 4, column 8), so we can conclude that the answer is 5.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along column 1.
A: To solve for (row 9, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 4, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 6, column 1), (row 4, column 1), or (row 5, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), and (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 3, column 2). (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 7, column 8), and (row 8, column 1) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 8, column 5). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 6, we can conclude that (row 9, column 1) must contain the 6.

A: To solve for (row 8, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 2, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 7, column 4), (row 2, column 4), or (row 9, column 4) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 4), and (row 6, column 4) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 4, column 5). (row 3, column 4) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 3, column 1). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 8, column 4) or (row 1, column 4) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 2 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 4 that can contain 2 is (row 8, column 4), so we can conclude that the answer is 2.

A: To solve for (row 9, column 7), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid,"	9 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 9, column 9), (row 9, column 2), or (row 9, column 8) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 9, column 4), (row 9, column 5), and (row 9, column 6) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 7, column 6). (row 9, column 3) cannot contain 9 because it shares a column with 9 in (row 2, column 3), and (row 9, column 1) cannot contain 9 because it shares a column with 9 in (row 4, column 1). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 9 as potential locations to place to put the 9, we can conclude that (row 9, column 7) must contain the 9.	9	12689	90569	90674	91064	92234	 1 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 1 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 1 cannot go in (row 9, column 5), (row 9, column 2), or (row 9, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them.

What number must (row 1, column 4) contain?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row 1.
A: To solve for (row 1, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 1 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 1 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 1 cannot go in (row 1, column 6), (row 1, column 5), or (row 1, column 2) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 7), (row 1, column 8), and (row 1, column 9) cannot contain 1 because they share a 3x3 box with 1 in (row 3, column 7). (row 1, column 3) cannot contain 1 because it shares a column with 1 in (row 6, column 3). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 1, column 4) or (row 1, column 1) from containing 1, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 5 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 1 that can contain 5 is (row 1, column 4), so we can conclude that the answer is 5.

(row 3, column 7), (row 3, column 8), and (row 3, column 9) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 2, column 8). (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 7 because it shares a column with 7 in (row 4, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 3, column 2) or (row 3, column 6) from containing 7, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 3 that can contain 3 is (row 3, column 2), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

A: To solve for (row 9, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 6, column 5), (row 8, column 5), or (row 5, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 5), (row 2, column 5), and (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 4 because they share a 3x3 box with 4 in (row 3, column 4). (row 4, column 5) cannot contain 4 because it shares a row with 4 in (row 4, column 9), and (row 7, column 5) cannot contain 4 because it shares a row with 4 in (row 7, column 8). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 5 as potential locations to place to put the 4, we can conclude that (row 9, column 5) must contain the 4.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row 2.
A: To solve for (row 2, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 4, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 2, column 1), (row 2, column 3), or (row 2, column 2) because these cells already have numbers in them.

However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 2, column 5) or (row 2, column 6) from containing 2, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 4 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 2 that can contain 4 is (row 2, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 4.

A: To solve for (row 3, column 3), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 3, column 4), (row 3, column 2), or (row 3, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 3, column 7), (row 3, column 8), and (row 3, column 9) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 1, column 7). (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 4, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 3, column 3) or (row 3, column 6) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 9 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 3 that can contain 9 is (row 3, column 3), so we can conclude that the answer is 9.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid,"	2 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), or (row 7, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 1), (row 5, column 1), and (row 6, column 1) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 6, column 2). (row 9, column 1) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 9, column 5), and (row 8, column 1) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 8, column 8). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 2, we can conclude that (row 3, column 1) must contain the 2.	2	194084	199454	199469	199949	200864	 1 and 2, we arbitrarily choose 1 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 1 cannot go in (row 2, column 1), (row 8, column 1), or (row 6, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them.

What number must (row 1, column 5) contain?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column 5.
A: To solve for (row 1, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 7, column 5), (row 3, column 5), or (row 2, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 5), (row 5, column 5), and (row 6, column 5) cannot contain 4 because they share a 3x3 box with 4 in (row 4, column 4). (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 4 because it shares a row with 4 in (row 9, column 9). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 1, column 5) or (row 8, column 5) from containing 4, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 5 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 5 that can contain 5 is (row 1, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 5.

(row 7, column 8), (row 8, column 8), and (row 9, column 8) cannot contain 3 because they share a 3x3 box with 3 in (row 9, column 9). (row 1, column 8) cannot contain 3 because it shares a row with 3 in (row 1, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 2, column 8) or (row 4, column 8) from containing 3, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 5 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 8 that can contain 5 is (row 2, column 8), so we can conclude that the answer is 5.

A: To solve for (row 6, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 9 and 2, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 8, column 8), (row 4, column 8), or (row 9, column 8) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 8), (row 2, column 8), and (row 3, column 8) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 1, column 9). (row 5, column 8) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 5, column 5), and (row 7, column 8) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 7, column 6). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 8 as potential locations to place to put the 9, we can conclude that (row 6, column 8) must contain the 9.

What number must (row 3, column 5) contain?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row 3.
A: To solve for (row 3, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 3, column 7), (row 3, column 6), or (row 3, column 4) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 3, column 1), (row 3, column 2), and (row 3, column 3) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 2, column 1).

However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 3, column 5) or (row 3, column 8) from containing 2, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 1 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 3 that can contain 1 is (row 3, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 1.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 4, column 5), (row 9, column 5), or (row 6, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 5), (row 2, column 5), and (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 3, column 4). (row 5, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 5, column 8). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 7, column 5) or (row 8, column 5) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 9 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 5 that can contain 9 is (row 7, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 9.
