What number must (row 1, column 1) contain?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column 1.
A: To solve for (row 1, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. We check whether the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 6, can go in the other cells. (row 3, column 1) shares a column with 5 but not 6, so we can conclude that the answer is 5.
