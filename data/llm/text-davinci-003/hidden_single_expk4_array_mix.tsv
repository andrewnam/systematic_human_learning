[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 5 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 5 cannot go in (row 8, column 1), (row 9, column 1), or (row 7, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 1), (row 5, column 1), and (row 6, column 1) cannot contain 5 because they share a 3x3 box with 5 in (row 6, column 2). (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 3, column 8), and (row 2, column 1) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 2, column 5). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 5, we can conclude that (row 1, column 1) must contain the 5.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 9 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 9, column 1), (row 6, column 1), or (row 5, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), and (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 1, column 2). (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 7, column 8). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 1) or (row 8, column 1) from containing 9, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 6 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 1 that can contain 6 is (row 4, column 1), so we can conclude that the answer is 6.

A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 2), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 5, column 2), (row 3, column 2), or (row 2, column 2) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 2), (row 8, column 2), and (row 9, column 2) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 9, column 3). (row 4, column 2) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 4, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 1, column 2) or (row 6, column 2) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 9 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 2 that can contain 9 is (row 1, column 2), so we can conclude that the answer is 9.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 4, column 9), (row 4, column 2), or (row 4, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 4), (row 4, column 5), and (row 4, column 6) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 6, column 6). (row 4, column 1) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 7, column 1). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 8) or (row 4, column 3) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 5 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 4 that can contain 5 is (row 4, column 8), so we can conclude that the answer is 5.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 5, column 5), (row 6, column 5), or (row 3, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 5), (row 8, column 5), and (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 8, column 4). (row 1, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 1, column 8). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 5) or (row 2, column 5) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 5 that can contain 3 is (row 4, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 9, column 4), (row 9, column 6), or (row 9, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 9, column 1), (row 9, column 2), and (row 9, column 3) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 7, column 2). (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 4, column 5), and (row 9, column 8) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 1, column 8). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 9 as potential locations to place to put the 8, we can conclude that (row 9, column 9) must contain the 8.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 9, column 9), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 1 and 8, we arbitrarily choose 1 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 1 cannot go in (row 9, column 8), (row 9, column 1), or (row 9, column 2) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 9, column 4), (row 9, column 5), and (row 9, column 6) cannot contain 1 because they share a 3x3 box with 1 in (row 8, column 6). (row 9, column 7) cannot contain 1 because it shares a column with 1 in (row 4, column 7). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 9, column 9) or (row 9, column 3) from containing 1, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 8 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 9 that can contain 8 is (row 9, column 9), so we can conclude that the answer is 8.

Choosing 1 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 4 that can contain 1 is (row 9, column 4), so we can conclude that the answer is 1.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 3, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 7, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 3, column 8), (row 3, column 6), or (row 3, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 3, column 1), (row 3, column 2), and (row 3, column 3) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 2, column 1). (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 8, column 5), and (row 3, column 9) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 4, column 9). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 3 as potential locations to place to put the 8, we can conclude that (row 3, column 4) must contain the 8.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 7 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 7 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 7 cannot go in (row 5, column 1), (row 6, column 1), or (row 2, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 1), (row 8, column 1), and (row 9, column 1) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 8, column 3). (row 4, column 1) cannot contain 7 because it shares a row with 7 in (row 4, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 1, column 1) or (row 3, column 1) from containing 7, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 1 that can contain 3 is (row 1, column 1), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 7, column 2), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 7, column 5), (row 7, column 6), or (row 7, column 4) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 7), (row 7, column 8), and (row 7, column 9) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 8, column 9). (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 2 because it shares a column with 2 in (row 6, column 1), and (row 7, column 3) cannot contain 2 because it shares a column with 2 in (row 2, column 3). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 7 as potential locations to place to put the 2, we can conclude that (row 7, column 2) must contain the 2.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 7, column 2), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 7 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 7 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 7 cannot go in (row 7, column 7), (row 7, column 8), or (row 7, column 9) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 4), (row 7, column 5), and (row 7, column 6) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 8, column 4). (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 7 because it shares a column with 7 in (row 5, column 1), and (row 7, column 3) cannot contain 7 because it shares a column with 7 in (row 3, column 3). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 7 as potential locations to place to put the 7, we can conclude that (row 7, column 2) must contain the 7.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 5, column 7), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 5, column 8), (row 5, column 2), or (row 5, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 5, column 4), (row 5, column 5), and (row 5, column 6) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 4, column 4). (row 5, column 9) cannot contain 6 because it shares a column with 6 in (row 2, column 9). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 5, column 7) or (row 5, column 3) from containing 6, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 1 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 5 that can contain 1 is (row 5, column 7), so we can conclude that the answer is 1.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 5, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row."	Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 8, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 5, column 6), (row 5, column 2), or (row 5, column 3) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 5, column 7), (row 5, column 8), and (row 5, column 9) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 4, column 7). (row 5, column 1) cannot contain 6 because it shares a column with 6 in (row 2, column 1), and (row 5, column 5) cannot contain 6 because it shares a column with 6 in (row 3, column 5). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 5 as potential locations to place to put the 6, we can conclude that (row 5, column 4) must contain the 6.	6	332144	183614	183764	184784	187979	 Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 8, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 5, column 1), (row 5, column 3), or (row 5, column 2) because these cells already have numbers in them.

A: To solve for X in (row 2, column 3), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 3, column 3), (row 1, column 3), or (row 9, column 3) because these cells already have numbers in them.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 8, column 6), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 5 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 5 cannot go in (row 9, column 6), (row 5, column 6), or (row 6, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them.

However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 8, column 6) or (row 4, column 6) from containing 5, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 6 that can contain 3 is (row 8, column 6), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 3, column 3), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 3, column 4), (row 3, column 2), or (row 3, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 3, column 7), (row 3, column 8), and (row 3, column 9) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 1, column 7). (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 4, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 3, column 3) or (row 3, column 6) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 9 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 3 that can contain 9 is (row 3, column 3), so we can conclude that the answer is 9.

A: To solve for X in (row 9, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 7, we arbitrarily choose 5 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 5 cannot go in (row 9, column 6), (row 9, column 5), or (row 9, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 9, column 1), (row 9, column 2), and (row 9, column 3) cannot contain 5 because they share a 3x3 box with 5 in (row 7, column 3). (row 9, column 9) cannot contain 5 because it shares a column with 5 in (row 6, column 9), and (row 9, column 4) cannot contain 5 because it shares a column with 5 in (row 3, column 4). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 9 as potential locations to place to put the 5, we can conclude that (row 9, column 8) must contain the 5.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 6, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 6, column 3), (row 6, column 7), or (row 6, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 6, column 4), (row 6, column 5), and (row 6, column 6) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 5, column 6). (row 6, column 9) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 2, column 9). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 6, column 8) or (row 6, column 2) from containing 8, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 6 that can contain 3 is (row 6, column 8), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 7 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 7 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 7 cannot go in (row 4, column 5), (row 6, column 5), or (row 8, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 5), (row 2, column 5), and (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 2, column 6). (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 7 because it shares a row with 7 in (row 9, column 7). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 5, column 5) or (row 7, column 5) from containing 7, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 3 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 5 that can contain 3 is (row 5, column 5), so we can conclude that the answer is 3.

A: To solve for X in (row 5, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 3, column 5), (row 1, column 5), or (row 4, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 5), (row 8, column 5), and (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 4 because they share a 3x3 box with 4 in (row 7, column 6). (row 2, column 5) cannot contain 4 because it shares a row with 4 in (row 2, column 7), and (row 6, column 5) cannot contain 4 because it shares a row with 4 in (row 6, column 8). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 5 as potential locations to place to put the 4, we can conclude that (row 5, column 5) must contain the 4.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 3, column 7), (row 8, column 7), or (row 7, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 7), (row 5, column 7), and (row 6, column 7) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 4, column 8). (row 2, column 7) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 2, column 3), and (row 1, column 7) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 1, column 5). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 7 as potential locations to place to put the 6, we can conclude that (row 9, column 7) must contain the 6.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 3), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 6, column 3), (row 5, column 3), or (row 4, column 3) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 3), (row 8, column 3), and (row 9, column 3) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 8, column 2). (row 2, column 3) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 2, column 8). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 1, column 3) or (row 3, column 3) from containing 6, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 1 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 3 that can contain 1 is (row 1, column 3), so we can conclude that the answer is 1.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row."	Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 4, column 6), (row 4, column 5), or (row 4, column 3) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 7), (row 4, column 8), and (row 4, column 9) cannot contain 4 because they share a 3x3 box with 4 in (row 5, column 7). (row 4, column 1) cannot contain 4 because it shares a column with 4 in (row 9, column 1), and (row 4, column 2) cannot contain 4 because it shares a column with 4 in (row 2, column 2). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 4 as potential locations to place to put the 4, we can conclude that (row 4, column 4) must contain the 4.	4	147569	302069	302819	304574	306104	 Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 4 and 5, we arbitrarily choose 4 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 4 cannot go in (row 4, column 7), (row 4, column 5), or (row 4, column 9) because these cells already have numbers in them.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 7, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 1, column 9), (row 1, column 2), or (row 1, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 3, column 7), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 8 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 8, column 7), (row 7, column 7), or (row 1, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 7), (row 5, column 7), and (row 6, column 7) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 6, column 8).

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 6), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 4, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 7, column 6), (row 6, column 6), or (row 9, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 6), (row 2, column 6), and (row 3, column 6) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 1, column 4). (row 8, column 6) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 8, column 3). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 4, column 6) or (row 5, column 6) from containing 2, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 4 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in column 6 that can contain 4 is (row 4, column 6), so we can conclude that the answer is 4.

Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 7 and 8, we arbitrarily choose 7 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 7 cannot go in (row 6, column 8), (row 6, column 5), or (row 6, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 6, column 1), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 3) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 5, column 3). (row 6, column 7) cannot contain 7 because it shares a column with 7 in (row 1, column 7), and (row 6, column 9) cannot contain 7 because it shares a column with 7 in (row 8, column 9). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 6 as potential locations to place to put the 7, we can conclude that (row 6, column 4) must contain the 7.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 6, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 3 and 7, we arbitrarily choose 3 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 3 cannot go in (row 6, column 9), (row 6, column 7), or (row 6, column 8) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 6, column 1), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 3) cannot contain 3 because they share a 3x3 box with 3 in (row 4, column 1). (row 6, column 5) cannot contain 3 because it shares a column with 3 in (row 8, column 5). However, there are no numbers that prevent either (row 6, column 4) or (row 6, column 6) from containing 3, so we cannot be certain about either. Choosing 7 as the new candidate and applying a similar logic, we can see that the only cell in row 6 that can contain 7 is (row 6, column 4), so we can conclude that the answer is 7.
