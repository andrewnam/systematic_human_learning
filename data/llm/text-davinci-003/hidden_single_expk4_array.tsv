[0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 9 and 6, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 5, column 1), (row 2, column 1), or (row 4, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 1), (row 8, column 1), and (row 9, column 1) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 9, column 2). (row 6, column 1) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 6, column 7), and (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 9 because it shares a row with 9 in (row 3, column 4). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 9, we can conclude that (row 1, column 1) must contain the 9.

A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 1), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 9, column 1), (row 6, column 1), or (row 5, column 1) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), and (row 3, column 1) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 3, column 3). (row 8, column 1) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 8, column 7), and (row 7, column 1) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 7, column 4). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 1 as potential locations to place to put the 6, we can conclude that (row 4, column 1) must contain the 6.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 7), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid,"	2 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 9, column 7), (row 5, column 7), or (row 7, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 7), (row 2, column 7), and (row 3, column 7) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 2, column 8). (row 8, column 7) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 8, column 5), and (row 6, column 7) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 6, column 3). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 7 as potential locations to place to put the 2, we can conclude that (row 4, column 7) must contain the 2.	2	16067	3836	4028	4242	4257	 8 and 2, we arbitrarily choose 8 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 8 cannot go in (row 4, column 1), (row 4, column 2), or (row 4, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them.

(row 1, column 6), (row 2, column 6), and (row 3, column 6) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 2, column 4). (row 6, column 6) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 6, column 2), and (row 8, column 6) cannot contain 8 because it shares a row with 8 in (row 8, column 3). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 6 as potential locations to place to put the 8, we can conclude that (row 7, column 6) must contain the 8.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 1, column 4), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 9 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 9 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 9 cannot go in (row 1, column 5), (row 1, column 6), or (row 1, column 7) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 2), and (row 1, column 3) cannot contain 9 because they share a 3x3 box with 9 in (row 3, column 1). (row 1, column 9) cannot contain 9 because it shares a column with 9 in (row 6, column 9), and (row 1, column 8) cannot contain 9 because it shares a column with 9 in (row 7, column 8). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 1 as potential locations to place to put the 9, we can conclude that (row 1, column 4) must contain the 9.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 8, column 3), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 7 and 9, we arbitrarily choose 7 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 7 cannot go in (row 7, column 3), (row 9, column 3), or (row 1, column 3) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 3), (row 5, column 3), and (row 6, column 3) cannot contain 7 because they share a 3x3 box with 7 in (row 5, column 1). (row 3, column 3) cannot contain 7 because it shares a row with 7 in (row 3, column 9), and (row 2, column 3) cannot contain 7 because it shares a row with 7 in (row 2, column 4). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 3 as potential locations to place to put the 7, we can conclude that (row 8, column 3) must contain the 7.

(row 9, column 7), (row 9, column 8), and (row 9, column 9) cannot contain 8 because they share a 3x3 box with 8 in (row 7, column 7). (row 9, column 5) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 6, column 5), and (row 9, column 6) cannot contain 8 because it shares a column with 8 in (row 2, column 6). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 9 as potential locations to place to put the 8, we can conclude that (row 9, column 1) must contain the 8.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 8, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 6 and 3, we arbitrarily choose 6 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 6 cannot go in (row 2, column 5), (row 1, column 5), or (row 9, column 5) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 5), (row 5, column 5), and (row 6, column 5) cannot contain 6 because they share a 3x3 box with 6 in (row 4, column 6). (row 7, column 5) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 7, column 3), and (row 3, column 5) cannot contain 6 because it shares a row with 6 in (row 3, column 9).

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the row that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 3, column 5), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its row. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 4, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 3, column 8), (row 3, column 4), or (row 3, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 3, column 1), (row 3, column 2), and (row 3, column 3) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 1, column 2). (row 3, column 7) cannot contain 2 because it shares a column with 2 in (row 9, column 7), and (row 3, column 9) cannot contain 2 because it shares a column with 2 in (row 4, column 9). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in row 3 as potential locations to place to put the 2, we can conclude that (row 3, column 5) must contain the 2.

What number must X be?
Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 8, column 6), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 2 and 7, we arbitrarily choose 2 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 2 cannot go in (row 9, column 6), (row 7, column 6), or (row 3, column 6) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 4, column 6), (row 5, column 6), and (row 6, column 6) cannot contain 2 because they share a 3x3 box with 2 in (row 5, column 5). (row 2, column 6) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 2, column 9), and (row 1, column 6) cannot contain 2 because it shares a row with 2 in (row 1, column 2). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 6 as potential locations to place to put the 2, we can conclude that (row 8, column 6) must contain the 2.

Hint: use the hidden single technique along the column that contains X.
A: To solve for X in (row 4, column 8), we need to find the number that cannot go in any other cell in its column. Between the two numbers that appear 3 times on the grid, 5 and 1, we arbitrarily choose 5 as a candidate to check whether it can go in the other cells. 5 cannot go in (row 2, column 8), (row 6, column 8), or (row 3, column 8) because these cells already have numbers in them. (row 7, column 8), (row 8, column 8), and (row 9, column 8) cannot contain 5 because they share a 3x3 box with 5 in (row 9, column 7). (row 5, column 8) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 5, column 1), and (row 1, column 8) cannot contain 5 because it shares a row with 5 in (row 1, column 2). Since we have eliminated all other eight cells in column 8 as potential locations to place to put the 5, we can conclude that (row 4, column 8) must contain the 5.
