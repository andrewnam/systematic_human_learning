<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
							    <p>
									The Parallel Distributed Processing Lab at Stanford University is looking for online participants
									for a brief psychology experiment. The only requirements 
									are that you are at least 18 years old, can comprehend written English, not using
									a mobile-device such as a phone or tablet, and using a supported browser such as
									Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
							    </p>
							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This HIT can only be completed once.</strong>
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the 
									HIT so someone else can participate.
									<br/><br/>
									<strong>This HIT contains moderate readings and cognitive exercises.</strong>
									While the tasks are not necessarily difficult, skimming through the instructions
									may make them so. If you do not wish to participate in a task that requires
									reading or cognitive effort, you may prefer to do a different HIT instead.
									<br/><br/>
									<strong>This HIT is under development.</strong>
									This HIT is currently being developed and fine-tuned, and may therefore contain
									bugs and incomplete features. Similarly, the payment structure is still under
									refinement as well so that each worker would receive fair, competitive, and
									appropriately rewarded for the task including bonuses. Note that all interactions
									within the task will be recorded.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>
							    

							{% else %}

								<!-- 
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit. 
									You should thus show them styleInstructions to begin the
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
